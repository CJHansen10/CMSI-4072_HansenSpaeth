5. Requirements Specification (SRS)
5.1 System Overview
5.1.1 Introduction

Pirate Fighters is a 2D, controller-friendly pirate fighting game designed for quick, accessible fun—especially for players who do not typically play fighting games. The system is primarily a Unity-based Windows client that provides a complete offline gameplay experience: title/menu flow, character and arena selection, a match loop with movement/combat/defense/special moves, audio/VFX feedback, and local profile/settings persistence.

Implementation details (algorithms, internal data models, UI wireframes, and development workflows) are intentionally excluded here and are covered in companion documents (e.g., ConOps and design specifications). This section defines what the system must do.
