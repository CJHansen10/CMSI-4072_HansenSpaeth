Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths:
      Clear decomposition into UI & Menu, Gameplay, and Content & Persistence.
      Subcomponents (CSUs) named and described in detail.
      Architecture diagram (text-based) reinforces structure.
   Suggestions:
      Add explicit mapping from components to lifecycle or data-flow diagrams.
      Include brief rationale for each CSC’s boundaries (why it is separated).

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      All major gameplay, UI, and persistence functions are clearly stated.
      Requirements use proper “shall” phrasing.
      Requirements are externally observable and testable.
   Suggestions:
      Some requirements could be more quantifiable (e.g., character roster
         count, minimum number of arenas).
      Consider adding negative requirements (what the system shall NOT do),
         if relevant, to limit scope.
      Add explicit error-handling behaviors (e.g., failure to load a profile).

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Very strong quantification: FPS, latency, load times, memory footprint.
      Requirements are realistic and verifiable.
      Stability and long‑session performance are addressed.
   Suggestions:
      Could identify minimum hardware test bench used to measure compliance.
      Could separate "hard" vs. "soft" performance constraints.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Clear development environment (hardware, OS, tools).
      Clear deployment targets, including minimum hardware.
      Accessibility and offline operation called out.
   Suggestions:
      Consider adding OS‑level permissions or file system assumptions.
      Provide version numbers or stability expectations for required runtimes.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown               1.0/1
   Functional Requirements           4.0/4
   Performance Requirements          2.0/2
   Environment Requirements          1.0/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                          8.0/8
   Preliminary Schedule              2.0/2   [Freebee]
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
You actually did the best of any SRS I've read so far and I'm halfway
through the projects!  You could make the document even stronger by
including some of the suggestions for the next go-round.

Nice work on this deliverable ~ keep up the good work!
