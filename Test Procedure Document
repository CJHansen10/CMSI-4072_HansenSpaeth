8.0 Software Test Plan
8.1 Introduction

This section defines the Software Test Plan for Pirate Fighterz. It describes the tests used to verify the project at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels.

This document serves two purposes:

Test planning (what is tested and why)

Test procedure guidance (how tests are performed)

Both positive (valid input) and negative (invalid input/error handling) tests are included.

CSCs Covered

UI & Menu CSC (title screen, menu navigation, character/map select)

Gameplay CSC (movement, jump, attack, block, damage, win condition)

Content & Persistence CSC (settings, save/load, profile data)

8.2 Unit Test Plan

Unit testing verifies individual scripts/modules in isolation.
