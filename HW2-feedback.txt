SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.2 ~ correct

Problem 5.4 ~ Problem 5.4 asks about two users playing over the Internet.
   Your answer does not propose a networked architecture
   (e.g., client/server, SOA) here which would be the way to go.

Problem 5.6 ~ This response actually addresses the networked chess scenario
   (client/server with authoritative state), but Problem 5.6 asks about
   ClassyDraw’s database structure and maintenance.  Wrong problem.

Problem 5.8 ~ correct, I think...  Maybe this should be the one above?

Problem 6.1 ~ correct, I think...

Problem 6.2 ~ Your diagram is NOT a 'class' diagram.  It shows some kind of
program 'flow', not a class hierarchy which was asked for.  Partial credit
for the work you did


It's a bit hard to follow this submission, since in the latter problems
you seem to be one off with your answers from what the questions are
asking.  I did my best to correlate them...

You have 8 answers but there were only 7 problems.
