VIDEO EVALUATION
================
Nice work on this presentation.  Pretty standard stuff, but you also seem
to have a good grasp of the project so you can describe it without having
to rely on a written script, which is great!  One thing you can keep in mind
for next time is to add some graphics to the presentation to add some extra
interest.  Since you have some parts working already, anything from there
that you can use will always add interest to the presentation.

Good work on the presentation.  Two out of Five points for the deliverable.
